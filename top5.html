                <h3>27 Dresses</h3>
                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 10/10</p>
                <p>This movie is just set up so cute, there are different plots happening at once. I love the chemistry between Kevin and Jane, they look so good together. I would say the ending is so cute with their wedding and my favorite scene from this movie is the bar scene with the song Bennie and the Jets.</p>

                <h3>10 Things I Hate About You </h3>
                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 9.5/10</p>
                <p>This movie is just so iconic. There are so many references in this classic film from Shakespeare's work. I think this movie has a perfect cast and the characters have so much chemistry. I would say that my favorite scene is the football field scene, where Patrick asks out Kat.</p>
            </li>

                <h3>To All the Boys I've Loved Before</h3>
                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 9/10</p>
                <p>This movie has the cutest and ideal highschool relationship. Peter Kavinsky is the most charming boyfriend, and the popular guy with the shy girl just makes the cutest ship. Despite all the obstacles, they pushed through and the sequel movies are also just as good as the original.</p>
            </li>

                <h3>How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days</h3>
                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 8.5/10</p>
                <p>I love how the enemies to lovers trope works in this film. Both of the characters are just so meant to be, and it is evident throughout the entire film. The yellow dress scene is so iconic and teh details in this movie are so perfect.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Anyone But You</h3>
                <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 8/10</p>
                <p>This one is more of a newer rom com, but the tension between the two characters is so good. Despite all the obstacles that they went through they just end up back together. I love the Helicopter scene with the song Unwritten.</p>
