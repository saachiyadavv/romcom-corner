        Andrew Garfield is my all time favorite actor and my celebrity crush. He is featured in many famous movies, and always brings the best performance, and he began acting at the age of 9. A fun fact about him is that although he was born in Los Angeles, he grew up in the UK which is why he has an English accent, and he can switch between his accents in his movies. Also, an honorable mention to his acting performance in his Spider-Man movies, especially the love story with Gwen and Peter as their love is so strong.
