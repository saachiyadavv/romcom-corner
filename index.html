        <p>
            Hi I'm Saachi and I'm a huge movie enthusiast, especially when it comes to Romantic Comedies. I have grown up watching these movie, and they hold so many memories, also these movies are something that is apart of my me-time. Let me elaborate on that a little, so something that I do every week is that I like to watch at least one rom-com a weekend, especially when week gets overwhelming.
            Also this may sound crazy but I do think that I have watched so many rom-coms in my life till the point that it has genuinely changed my perception on life and love. This website is my personal space to share my favorite Rom-Coms, my thoughts on them,
            and perhaps you will also have a new movie favorite!!
