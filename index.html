        <h2>What is This Site About?</h2>
        <p>
            Hi I'm Saachi and I'm a huge movie enthusiast, especially when it comes to Romantic Comedies. I have grown up watching these movie, and they hold so many memories, also these movies are something that is apart of my me-time. Let me elaborate on that a little, so something that I do every week is that I like to watch at least one rom-com a weekend, especially when week gets overwhelming.
            Also this may sound crazy but I do think that I have watched so many rom-coms in my life till the point that it has genuinely changed my perception on life and love. This website is my personal space to share my favorite Rom-Coms, my thoughts on them,
            and perhaps you will also have a new movie favorite!!
        </p>
        <p>Here you'll find:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>My all-time favorite movies with reviews.</li>
            <li>A gallery of memorable movie moments.</li>
            <li>A spotlight on an actor I admire.</li>
            <li>My personal movie bucket list I'm working through!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I hope you enjoy looking around and maybe even find a new favorite movie!

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            Building this website started off simple, but it definitely pushed me out of my comfort zone and created a lot of frustrations.
            One of the biggest challenges I had was making the site mobile-friendly. 
            At first, it looked fine on my computer, but when I opened it on my phone, the layout completely fell apart and the styling didn‚Äôt show. 
            I had to research different ways to fix that, and eventually found out about external hosting with GitHub, which helped everything load properly and look how I actually designed it. 
            I also realized early on that my site didn‚Äôt look as visually appealing as I wanted and it felt kind of basic and flat. 
            That led me to research more with CSS styling, color palettes, and layout ideas. Overall, I‚Äôm proud of how it turned out, 
            especially because it reflects something I genuinely love. 
            This project taught me not just about code, but also allowed me to talk about a topic of interest, but I do admit I struggled a lot with it especially because it was so time consuming.
